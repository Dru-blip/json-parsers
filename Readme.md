# JSON Parsers

This project is a collection of JSON parsers built for learning purposes.
The goal is to understand how JSON parsing works by implementing custom parsers in different programming languages.

## 🚀 Features
- ✅ Custom JSON parsing logic
- ⚠️ Error handling for invalid JSON
- 📂 Support for nested objects and arrays
- 🌍 Implementations in multiple languages

## 📋 TODO

<ul>
  <li>- [ ] Add error handling for invalid JSON</li>
  <li>- [ ] Implement JSON parsing in additional languages</li>
  <li>- [ ] Improve error handling and validation</li>
  <li>- [ ] Add unit tests</li>
</ul>

## 🤝 Contributing
<p>This project is for personal learning, but feel free to fork it and improve upon it.</p>


## 📌 Implementations

The following languages are used for JSON parsing:

- [x] TypeScript ✅
- [ ] Rust (planned)

## 🔧 Usage
Each implementation is stored in its respective directory. Run the parser in your chosen language by executing the corresponding script.

### Example (TypeScript)

```deno(ts)
cd json-ts
deno run dev
